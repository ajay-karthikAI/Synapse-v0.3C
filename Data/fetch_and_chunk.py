"""
Day 1: Data Ingestion + Chunking
================================================================
Data sources supported:
  - PubMed abstracts via NCBI E-utilities (no API key needed)
  - Raw .txt files
  (PDF ingestion was advertised here but never worked — removed 2026-08-14, see
   "Source B" below.)
 
Chunking:
  - RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (LangChain) — respects sentence/paragraph
    boundaries before falling back to character splits. Better than naive
    sliding-window for preserving semantic units.
 
Metadata:
  - Custom Chunk dataclass keeps citation data (PMID / filename / page)
    first-class rather than buried in a generic dict.
 
Persistence:
  - Chunks saved to .pkl so you don't re-fetch on every run.

NOTE: PubMed API calls the content of this RAGbot; other files will use OPENAI API to convert content into vectors

# Why RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter?

#   because the embedding vector is semantically ambiguous.

        separators=["\n\n", "\n", ".", " "], #Priority hierarchy for splitting; tries to split at double newlines first (paragraphs), then single newlines (line breaks), then periods (sentences), then spaeces (words) as a last resort; preserves semantic coherence in chunks; progressive degradation

# `chunks_from_pdf` was deleted during the final audit because it could never
# have run: its first statement imported `langchain_community`, a package that
# appears nowhere in requirements.txt and has never been installed. Any call
# raised ModuleNotFoundError before touching the file. It was dead code that
# made the module docstring, the README and requirements.txt all advertise a
# capability the system does not have — `pypdf` was pinned solely to support it.
#
# Re-adding PDF ingestion means declaring the dependency, handling encrypted and
# scanned PDFs, and deciding what provenance a PDF chunk even carries (a PubMed
# chunk has a PMID; an arbitrary PDF has nothing a citation can be verified
# against). That is a governance question, not just a parsing one — see
# docs/SOURCE_GOVERNANCE.md.

        Insulin resistance is a pathological condition in which cells fail to respond
        normally to the hormone insulin. When the body produces insulin under conditions
        of insulin resistance, the cells are resistant to the insulin and are unable to
        use it as effectively, leading to high blood sugar. Beta cells in the pancreas
        subsequently increase their production of insulin, further contributing to a high
        blood insulin level. This often remains undetected and can contribute to a
        diagnosis of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is associated
        with various conditions such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
        cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary
