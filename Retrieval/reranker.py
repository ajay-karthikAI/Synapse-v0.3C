Day 5: Reranking
================
Takes the top-k results from hybrid retrieval (Day 4) and re-scores
them using an LLM to improve precision before answer generation.
 
Why reranking?
  Retrieval optimizes for recall — get everything potentially relevant.
  Reranking optimizes for precision — surface the most useful chunks.
  Without reranking, the LLM sees noisy context and either hallucinates
  to fill gaps or produces a diluted answer averaging across irrelevant chunks.
 
Two strategies implemented:
  1. LLM reranking   — GPT scores each chunk's relevance (0-10)
  2. Cross-encoder   — dedicated model scores query-chunk pairs
                       (included as upgrade path, not default)
 
For a waiting room patient tool, LLM reranking is the right default:
  - No extra model download
  - Scores are interpretable (maps to a relevance score, NOT a calibrated
    confidence in the medical content — see docs/citation-integrity.md)
  - Can be prompted to weight patient-friendliness alongside relevance
 
Interview talking point:
  "Reranking separates retrieval from precision. I retrieve broadly
  with hybrid search to maximize recall, then rerank to maximize
  precision before the LLM sees the context. This reduces hallucination
  because the model isn't trying to reconcile irrelevant chunks."

The patient is in a waiting room and wants to understand their condition and prepare questions for their doctor.
 
Score the passage from 0 to 10 based on:
